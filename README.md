# Machine Learning Visualization Tool

The goal of the project is to create a tool that would facilitate the comparison of different information sources used in image and document recognition experiments.
This tool would allow the user to compare sources such as the ground truth, the original subject, the experiment results and others in a synchronized manner. Meaning that the user could apply basic image processing operation on a set of images simultaneously.
